# Intuitive Webscraper

## Overview
A webscraper and stock watchlist app that scrapes stock data. Users can
add new stocks to the watchlist via searching the ticker catalog for a
ticker symbol or public company to add or simply inputting the ticker
symbol. The watchlist can be managed by the user and is updated every day
to reflect the newest information and open and closing prices for the stocks.

The scraper utilizes Beautiful Soup to scrap data, while using Flask app
